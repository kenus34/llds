/*
* A standard Future in Java only allows you to:

Check if the computation is complete (isDone()).
Block and wait for the computation to finish (get()).
Cancel the computation (cancel()).
* While that covers the basics, it often forces you into
* blocking your thread by calling get(). In contrast, CompletableFuture
*  offers a more comprehensive API for asynchronous programming. It
* allows you to register callbacks that get triggered automatically
* when the asynchronous computation finishesâ€”removing or reducing
* the need for explicitly blocking calls.
*
* One of the big advantages of CompletableFuture is that you can chain multiple
* stages of computation in a very readable way. This is extremely useful for scenarios where:

You retrieve some data asynchronously.
You then transform that data.
You maybe transform it again.
And eventually consume the final result.
